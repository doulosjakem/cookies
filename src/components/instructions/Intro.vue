    <p class="text-start img-thumbnail">
      I'm not sure exactly where this recipe originally came from, it was from
      an old red and white recipe book that belonged to my mom. This recipe has
      been battle-tested, compared vigorously to other cookie recipes and
      something about it just comes out fantastic every time. Something about
      both butter and shortening together. Many recipes use them
      interchangeably, or one or the other. Iâ€™m happy to share a staple from my
      home to yours. I hope you try these cookies, share them with your kids,
      and share them with your friends. Happy Baking!
