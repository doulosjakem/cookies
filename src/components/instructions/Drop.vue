    <h2>Drop and Bake</h2>
    <p class="img-thumbnail text-start">
      Drop cookies onto an ungreased cookie sheet to desired size (On a standard
      cookie sheet, I usually drop 12 cookies). Then bake in a 375 oven for 8-10
      minutes (for me, 8 minutes is always enough to leave them perfectly
      underdone). Remove, and let cool. Makes about 2 dozen.
